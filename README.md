# sql-challenge
I used Perplexity to help me complete this challenge.

Prompt 1: [Inserted Project Instructions]
Explains how to go about the project without fully tackling the project

Prompt 2: [Inserted Project Requirements]
Coded 2 SQL Files:
Was not in a text editor so I needed to determine where to put the code for its proper functioning.

Prompt 3: How do I create the files in which I can paste the code?
    "New-Item -ItemType File -Name ERD.txt
    New-Item -ItemType File -Name table_schemata.sql
    New-Item -ItemType File -Name queries.sql
    New-Item -ItemType File -Name README.md"    

I used terminal to create the files I needed.

Step 4:
I opened the files in vs code and pasted the generated code.
    table_schemata.sql: This file has the code to create all the database tables.
    queries.sql: This file contains SQL queries to analyze the employee data.

Prompt 4: queries.sql & tabel_schemate.sql have been made but not erd
overly basic answer

Prompt 5: "How do I create the erd using quick DBD. The reference files are departments, dept_emp, dept_manager, employees, salaries, titles?

This helped me process what exactly it is I am trying to do with the diagram.
I then imported the table_schemata.sql into quick DBD.
I used QuickDBD app and formatted the diagram showing how all the tables connect.
I verified the ERD matched my database structure.
Saving the ERD:
After finishing the diagram in QuickDBD, I saved it as an image file named pewlett-hackard-emp-db-erd.png.
